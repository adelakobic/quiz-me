* The language for the website is written in English. 

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Problems encountered 🤯
* geting the JavaScript to work
* JavaSCript keeps throwing up console error messages which I have been unable to resolve 28/7/22 
* 16/9/22 when the start button is clicked - the question appears but not the answers

## Changes made to the code 𝌡
* HTML code created 23/7/22
* CSS code created 23/7/22
* different JS code attempted but not working at present 24/7/22
* got rid of the start button and entered the quiz questions into the HTML instead 28/7/22
* revisited the code to look at JS - timer has been deployed so it counts down 16/9/22
* moved the questions into arrays 16/9/22
* changed HTML to be more simpler 16/9/22
